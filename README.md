# Pulses Expander (for Turing Machine)


The circuit here is a direct copy of the [Music Thing Modular Volts Expander](https://github.com/TomWhitwell/Turing-Pulse-Expander).

The KiCAD project here uses the library/footprints [found in my companion repo](https://github.com/thismatters/EurorackKiCAD).


## Width

6hp

## Inputs

The back of the module has a connection for the `pulses` output from the Turing Machine.

## Outputs

11 jacks which pulse along with the bits (and combinations thereof) on the Turing Machine.

## Vendors

There are part numbers in the [BOM](tm-pulses.csv) for many of the parts (not for basic passives though) at the following vendors:

* [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com): Needs no introduction. Get your ICs from here (or [digikey](https://www.digikey.com)).
* [Tayda Electronics](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/): Good supplier for passive components; audio jacks, and potentiometers. Their audio jacks are slightly smaller than the thonkiconn from thonk.
* [Love My Switches](https://lovemyswitches.com/): Has [really good knobs](https://lovemyswitches.com/anodized-aluminum-knob-the-lo-fi-1-4-smooth-shaft-12-5mm-od/) to go on those potentiometers!
* [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/): Fast and (relatively) cheap PCB manufacturer. Prototype run pending.
